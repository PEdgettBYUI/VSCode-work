        <h2>Today We're losing the fight to keep the media we purchase</h2>
        <p>Everyday we see more and more stories appearing talking about digital stores closing and games and movies being pulled off digital shelves, even from peoples libraries. Or that a popular show is leaving a streaming service with no plans to host it anywhere else.</p>

        <p>Today everyone has a computer. Some have laptops or desktops or video game consoles or a streaming device, but everyone no matter of financial status has a smart phone. And today physical media is going the way of the dodo. For every audiophile who swears on vinyl, there’s thousands more people who buy music exclusively digitally, if at all. Streaming is everywhere, it’s so ubiquitous that it’s overwhelming. We’re swamped and swarmed by services that offer digital access to movies, music, games, audio books & podcasts, and we’re so used to the convenience of them that we never stop to ask “Do I actually own these things I love?”</p>
        <h2>Why it matters</h2>

        <p>No. You don’t. And every day there’s more and more pieces of media lost to time because we don’t have systems in place to preserve the things we enjoy for the future. Once upon a time, when everything was still sold on CDs or cartridges or tapes if a company recalled an album or movie because of public outcry, or stopped making something because a license expired, you still owned what you bought, no one could just rip it away from you. Now though music and movies can be removed from your digital library at the will of the platform owner, video games require live services to function or download the game, even if you bought the physical copy for the game many games these days require massive patches to even function on day 1, to the extent that some discs are glorified license keys. Turn off your WiFi and see what you actually own in your library sometime, you might be horrified to see how little belongs to you.</p> 
        <p>Check Steam if you have it. You’ll see that Valve has been forced by legal pressure to be upfront about how little your investment belongs to you (Steam now says the ‘game’ you’re buying is really just a license - The Verge). Even something as basic as a eBook, little more than text on a screen like you’re reading right now can be stripped from you, and the files are loaded with various forms of Digital Rights Management (DRM) that prevents you from accessing what you have without the correct hardware or even an internet connection.</p>
