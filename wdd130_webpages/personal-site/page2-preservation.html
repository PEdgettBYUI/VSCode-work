            <h2>Lost Media</h2>
            <p> Nearly every piece of media is at risk of becoming lost media. Lost media being any media that we know about that cannot be accessed by people legally,
                you can gain a cursory knowledge of the topic from this Wikipedia article 
                <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_media">(Lost media – Wikipedia).</a>
                According to The Library of Congress over 70% of silent films released between 1912-1929 are considered lost media. 
                There is, as far as we know, no functioning copy of as much as 70% of the films released in a 17 year period that we know existed 
                <a href="https://www.loc.gov/item/prn-13-209/endangered-silent-film-heritage/2013-12-04/#:~:text=The%20groundbreaking%20study%20reveals%20some,exist%20in%20their%20original%20format.">(Library Reports on America’s Endangered Silent-Film Heritage | Library of Congress).</a>
                That’s horrifying. Imagine if in 10 years you feel nostalgic for a popular artist from today, and you go back to find that all their music is gone forever because it was only released digitally and the platforms that published it no longer existed. You may already have experienced this today. The first mainstream digital store for video games the “Wii Shop Channel” closed down forever on January 30th 2019 
                <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/27560/~/wii-shop-channel-discontinuation">(Nintendo Support: Wii Shop Channel Discontinuation).</a>
                Many titles on the store were digital only, and were never ported from there to anywhere else. In 2020 & 2023 the Nintendo 3DS and Wii U eShops also closed forever, making thousands more games unavailable for purchase 
                <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/57847/~/wii-u-%26-nintendo-3ds-eshop-discontinuation-q%26a" >(Nintendo Support: Wii U & Nintendo 3DS eShop Discontinuation Q&A).</a>
                But these games may be preserved, however only by private collectors, and distributing this otherwise unavailable software is considered illegal in nearly every part of the world.</p> 
        </section>

        <section class="topic-essay">
            <h2>Degrading Media, and The Unavailability of What’s Left</h2>
            <p> And even if you have a fully functioning physical copy of any media, physical media degrades overtime. Even now discs from as early as the 1990s are beginning to corrode and become unusable. According to Phil Salvador, director of the Video Game History Foundation, 87% of Video games released before 2010 are out of print and cannot be acquired outside of the “grey market” or pirating the software, which is a federal crime in the US with penalties or prison times and heavy financial fines 
                <a href="https://www.geekwire.com/2023/researchers-find-87-of-u-s-classic-video-games-are-out-of-print-and-critically-endangered/">(Researchers find 87% of U.S. classic video games are out of print and 'critically endangered' – GeekWire).</a>
                Gary Bowser, a hacker convicted of video game piracy in 2021 was sentenced to 40-months and a $4.5 Million dollar fine (Nintendo Switch Piracy Ring Leader Sentenced to 40 Months in Prison).</p>

        <section class="topic-essay">
            <h2>Hobbyists Hold The Key</h2>
            <p> Right now everything is in the hands of hobbyists. Efforts being made are insufficient. People get together in small, unsupported communities donating their freetime and money to make sure that old media doesn’t become lost media. VHS tapes & CDs are already beginning to erode away, and there just aren’t efforts to preserve them being made (VHS Tapes: How Archivists Are Working To Save Them : All Tech Considered : NPR). Everyday there’s a new lawsuit about someone uploading a copy of an old game online because you haven’t been able to buy it in 30 years. Read that again for a moment, someone is being sued for taking steps to preserve a piece of media no one can buy. It sounds deranged, but that’s the reality of it. People like the Internet Archive, who are a non-profit organization of volunteers have been entrenched in legal battles since the first COVID lockdown when they launched the “National Emergency Public Library” initiative. The NEPL was launched to ensure students, hospital workers, lawyers, and many many more could have access to a copy of a eBook while they were locked in their homes during COVID, many of which could contain life saving information, or be neccessary for someone trying to pass an exam like the BAR, and the US Copyright Office has sued them in an effort to prevent them from lending out resources at all, and even to purge their archives of information (Internet Archive Loses Copyright Lawsuit: What to Know | TIME). And again in just the past month the US Copyright Office has deemed that the Video Game History Foundation can’t get the same rights as researchers in other fields, that being to acquire and study copies of games, and preserve them in a private collection for fears that they “may use [the games] for recreational purposes” (US Copyright Office Deals Blow to Video Game Conservationists | PCMag).</p>
